Walkable 3D Town (Root&Render Edition)

This project showcases a small first‑person 3D town built with Three.js and vanilla web technologies. It provides a natural, calming experience inspired by the Root&Render ethos, allowing users to explore a grassy world dotted with houses and trees. The project supports both desktop and mobile devices.

Features
	•	Simple environment with a flat grass plane, 3–5 houses, a scattering of trees, and connecting paths.
	•	Natural aesthetics drawn from nature and the sunlight coding philosophy: soft earth and sky tones, gentle lighting, and simple geometry.
	•	Desktop controls: click the page to start, move with the Arrow keys (or WASD), and look around with the mouse. Press Esc to unlock the pointer.
	•	Mobile controls: tap to start, drag the left pad to walk forward/backwards/strafe, and drag the right pad to look around. Lift your finger to stop.
	•	Lightweight performance tuned for mobile devices; shadows are disabled on mobile to maximize frame rate.
	•	Basic collision detection prevents you from walking through house walls.
